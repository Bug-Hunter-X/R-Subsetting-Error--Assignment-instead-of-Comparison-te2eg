This repository contains an example of a common error in R programming related to data frame subsetting. The `bug.R` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected code. The error arises from using an assignment operator (`=`) instead of a comparison operator (`==`) when subsetting a data frame. This results in unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates the correct usage of comparison operators for subsetting.
